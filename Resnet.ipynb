[ResNet34](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf). ResNet architecture has had great success within the last few years and still considered state-of-the-art, so I believe there is great value in discussing it a bit. If you are interested solely in getting the Image Recognizer to work, feel free to skip the next few paragraphs.\n","\n","First, what’s CNN again? We can think of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or convNet) as a list of layers that transform the image volume into an output volume, which can be a class score as it is the case in this tutorial. For an in-depth read, I would highly recommend [Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) from Stanford’s CS231 class.\n","\n","What is special about ResNet architecture is how it tackles _the degradation problem_ most common in deep networks, where the model accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly. It is important to note here that although some assume that the core idea behind ResNets is overcoming the notorious _vanishing gradient problem_, where gradients get infinitely small as they back-propagate to earlier layers of the network, this is not quite true. \n","\n","Resnet architecture introduces an \"identity shortcut connection\" or often referred to as a \"skip connection\", which skips one or more layers. The shortcut connections simply perform identity mappings, and their outputs are added to\n","the outputs of the stacked layers, as shown in the figure below. The skip function creates what is known as a residual block, F(x) in our figure, and that's where the name Residual Nets (ResNets) came from.  \n","\n","<img width=\"286\" alt=\"Tutorial1_img1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8379428/56853841-f6429600-68e1-11e9-9cf3-a2ca324c277b.png\">\n","\n","Comprehensive empirical evidence has shown that the addition of these identity mappings allows the model to go deeper without degradation in performance and such networks are easier to optimize than plain stacked layers. There are several variants of ResNets, such as ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152; the number represents the number of layers (depth) of the ResNet. \n","\n","<img width=\"216\" alt=\"Tutorial1_img1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8379428/56853787-5e44ac80-68e1-11e9-9750-e9f5e417cf1e.png\">\n","\n","Image credit: [ResNet34](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)\n","\n","In this tutorial, we are using ResNet34. Feel free to try any of the other ResNet models by simply replacing `models.resnet34` by `models.resnet50` for instance, but bare in mind that increasing the number of layers would require more GPU memory."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9c41LyEZ9aqK"},"source":["Let's now pick the appropriate learning rate
